Problem 6 and Bonus Problem  from http://www.cs.ubbcluj.ro/~rlupsa/edu/grafe/lab4.html

6. Write a program that, given an undirected connected graph, constructs a minumal spanning tree using the Prim's algorithm.

2B. Write a program that, given a graph, does the following:
  -verify if the corresponding graph is a DAG and performs a topological sorting of the activities;
  -if it is a DAG, finds the number of distinct paths between two given vertices, in O(m+n).
